# California Housing Data Analysis

This project presents a simple exploratory data analysis and linear regression model using the California housing dataset. The goal is to explore the relationship between median income and median house value, and to create a basic prediction model.

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Visual exploration of key variables
* Correlation heatmap
* Linear regression using scikit-learn
* Model evaluation with Mean Squared Error (MSE)
